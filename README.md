# Simple Web Portfolio

This project is an assignment from Infinite Learning, where I built a simple portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can view the live version of the website [here](https://mesakhlolo.github.io/portfolio-infinite-learning/).

## Philosophy

"Good design is as little design as possible."

In building this portfolio, I embraced simplicity, clarity, and minimalism. This approach not only streamlines the development process but also delivers a seamless and impactful experience for users. By minimizing unnecessary elements and focusing on essentials, the content can truly stand out and clean, straightforward, and effective. CSS skill issue ðŸ¤“
